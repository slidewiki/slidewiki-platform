# Contributing to SlideWiki

Many thanks for becoming involved in SlideWiki development! :+1:

# Code contributions 

We have an active Slack community on http://slidewiki.slack.com/ - do not hesitate to join and ask any question there.

If you want to extend SlideWiki/add your own feature and want it to be part of the SlideWiki codebase, you can create a 
Pull Request which will then be reviewed before merging.

If you want to become active in developing the core features of SlideWiki we would be very happy :) 
We have a JIRA system to keep track of issues, bugs, tasks, improvements, etc.. which you could then join.
Please contact us on Slack, or via Github (people tab in the SlideWiki project), or via the project website slidewiki.eu. 

SlideWiki.org is updated monthly with a new release, at least until december 2018. 
Your changes will be visible there after the monthly update.  
Merged PRs will be visible after a few minutes on platform.experimental.slidewiki.org thanks to our CI/CD :tada:

One thing to note is that we use ESlint (see config files in root directory)

How to run SlideWiki on your local machine is explained in the readme.md in the respective repositories (platform-UI and microservices)

# Translating the User Interface 
For translating the UI, we have a Transifex project at https://www.transifex.com/slidewiki/ 
for which you can sign up and start translating.
We download the translation results from Transifex and then update all languages at once 
before we release once a month and update slidewiki.org.
Storing the translations in Transifex helps us keep an overview.
